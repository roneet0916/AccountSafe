"""
Notification utilities for login tracking and security alerts.

This module provides backwards-compatible wrapper functions that delegate
to the SecurityService. These functions are used by authentication views
to record login attempts and send security notifications.

Note: The actual implementations live in api.features.security.services.SecurityService.
This module provides a cleaner import path for cross-feature usage.
