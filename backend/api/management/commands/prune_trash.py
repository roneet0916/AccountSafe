"""
Prune Trash Management Command

Permanently deletes profiles that have been in trash for more than 30 days.
Uses crypto-shredding to overwrite encrypted data before deletion.

SECURITY: This implements the "Crypto-Shred" technique:
1. Overwrites encrypted fields with random data
2. Saves the overwritten data (writes to disk sectors)
3. Deletes the database record

This prevents recovery of deleted credentials even with disk forensics.

Usage:
    python manage.py prune_trash           # Normal run
    python manage.py prune_trash --dry-run # Preview what would be deleted
    python manage.py prune_trash --days=7  # Override retention period
