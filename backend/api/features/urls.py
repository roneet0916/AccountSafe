Feature-based URL routing.

This aggregates all feature module URLs into a single router.
All API endpoints are organized by domain concern:
- auth: Authentication (ZK, OTP, PIN)
- vault: Vault management (categories, organizations, profiles)
- security: Security features (health score, sessions, settings, canary traps)
- shared-secrets: Secure link sharing
