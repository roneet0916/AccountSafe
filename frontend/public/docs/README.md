# AccountSafe

A self-hosted, zero-knowledge credential manager.

---
## Why AccountSafe

The server is blind.
AccountSafe encrypts all sensitive data in the browser before transmission. The server stores only ciphertext. A compromised database yields no usable information.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant B as Browser (Client)
    participant S as Server (Django)
    participant DB as Database

    Note over U,B: ZERO KNOWLEDGE ZONE
    U->>B: Input Master Password
    B->>B: Argon2id Key Derivation (Salt+Pass)
    B->>B: Derive Auth Hash + Master Encryption Key
    
    Note right of B: Password & Key NEVER leave Browser
    
    B->>S: Send Auth Hash ONLY
    S->>DB: Verify Auth Hash
    DB-->>S: OK
    S-->>B: Return Encrypted Vault Blob
    B->>B: AES-256-GCM Decrypt with Master Key
    B-->>U: Display Vault
```

**The encryption key never leaves your device.**

## Features

### Zero-Knowledge Security
- **Zero-Knowledge Encryption**: AES-256-GCM with Argon2id key derivation (memory-hard KDF)
- **Zero-Knowledge Authentication**: Password never leaves your device; only derived `auth_hash` is transmitted
- **Zero-Knowledge Export/Import**: Encrypted vault backup that only you can decrypt

### Active Defense
- **Duress Mode (Ghost Vault)**: Alternate password reveals a decoy vault with fake low-value credentials. Attacker sees "Netflix" and "Spotify" logins while your real vault remains hidden.
- **Canary Trap Credentials**: Plant fake credentials that trigger silent alerts when accessed. Know immediately if your exported data is compromised.
- **SOS Email Alerts**: Automatic notification to a trusted contact when duress mode is activated

### Security Intelligence
- **Security Health Score**: Real-time vault security assessment (password strength, reuse, age, breach status)
- **Breach Detection**: Integration with Have I Been Pwned API
- **Session Management**: View and revoke active sessions across devices

### Secure Sharing
- **Shared Secrets**: Time-limited, passphrase-protected credential sharing
- **Auto-Expiry**: Shared links automatically expire and self-destruct

### Convenience
- **Digital Wallet**: Visual credit card storage with masked display
- **Smart Import**: Bulk import from browser password exports (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
- **Brand Detection**: Automatic logo fetching for organizations

### Data Safety
- **Automated Backups**: PostgreSQL dumps every 6 hours with 7-day retention
- **One-Command Restore**: Full disaster recovery via `./scripts/restore.sh`
- **Encrypted Backups**: Optional GPG encryption for backup files
- **Off-site Ready**: Backups stored in `./backups/` for easy S3/GCS sync

## Quick Start

### Production

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pankaj-bind/AccountSafe.git
cd AccountSafe
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env    # Configure backend settings
cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env  # Configure frontend API URL
make init-ssl                            # Initialize Let's Encrypt certificates

# First deployment (builds images with pinned dependencies)
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build

# Subsequent runs (uses cached images)
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

> **Note:** The `--build` flag is required on first run and after dependency updates. All dependencies are strictly pinned to prevent supply chain attacks.

**Migrating from another server?**
```bash
# Copy backups folder from old server, then:
./scripts/restore.sh
```

### Development

```bash
make dev  # Starts both backend and frontend with hot reload
```

Or manually:

```bash
# Backend
cd backend && python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt && python manage.py migrate && python manage.py runserver

# Frontend
cd frontend && npm install && npm start
```
